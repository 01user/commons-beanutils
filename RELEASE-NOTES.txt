                          Commons BeanUtils Package
                                Version 1.2
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
BeanUtils package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  The
current release adds one major new feature and several bug fixes, and is
being done now to provide a stable starting point for some major enhancements.


NEW FEATURES:

* The protected methods in PropertyUtils used to identify the Method objects
  for specific sets of argument types has been extracted into a new
  "MethodUtils" class and made public, because they are generally useful.
  In addition, several convenience methods have been added to utilize the
  new Method finding capabilities.


BUG FIXES:

* MappedPropertyDescriptor - Modified the two-argument constructor so that
  read-only properties (no setter method) are correctly recognized.

* PropertyUtils - When searching for public methods, also search the public
  methods of interfaces implemented by superclasses of the current class,
  not just those implemented by the current class itself.
