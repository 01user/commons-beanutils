Compatibility with 1.8.0
========================
BeanUtils 1.8.1 is binary compatible release with Beanutils 1.8.0, containing mostly bug fixes.

BeanUtils 1.8.1 requires a minimum of JDK 1.3.

Memory Leak
===========
A memory leak was found in BeanUtils 1.7.0 (see BEANUTILS-291) which was fixed
in BeanUtils 1.8.0 for JDK 1.5+.

Testing of BeanUtils 1.8.1 revealed that the leak still appears to exist
(in both BeanUtils 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 versions) in IBM's JDK 1.6 implementation.
