                          Commons BeanUtils Package
                                Version 1.3
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
BeanUtils package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  The
current release adds new features and bug fixes, and is being done now to
follow the release early/release often mentality.


NEW FEATURES:

* DynaBeans are here.  Ever wondered how to created loosely typed objects like
  python has?  That's DynaBean!  Use them for EJB Dependent Objects, easy
  representation of servlet parameters as a JavaBean, and more.

* PropertyUtils has been upgraded to allow getters and setters on List objects.
  Note that this is a deviation from the JavaBeans spec, but was done to make
  life easier for a developer using BeanUtils.  To be more specific, the spec is
  located at http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/beans.101.pdf and we
  violating section 8.3.3 ;-)  We hope that eventually the JavaBeans spec might
  be updated to include this feature.

* Logging - BeanUtils now uses the commons-logging API to do any logging.
  System.out.println() has been deprecated ;-)


BUG FIXES:
